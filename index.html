<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p><b>People have always copied things. In the past, most items of value were physical objects.  Patent law and
    economies of scale meant that small scale copying of physical objects was usually uneconomic, and large-scale
    copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using policemen and courts.  Today, things of value are increasingly less
    tangible: often they are just bits and bytes or can be accurately represented as bits and bytes.</b></p>
<p>The widespread deployment of packet-switched networks and the huge advances in computers and codec-technologies has
    made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to deliver such digital works over the Internet.  This presents great
    opportunities and great challenges.  The opportunity is low-cost delivery of personalized, desirable high-quality
    content.  The challenge is that such content can be distributed illegally.  Copyright law governs the legality of
    copying and distribution of such valuable data, but copyright protection is increasingly strained in a world of
    programmable computers and high-speed networks.</p>
<p align="middle"><i>For example, consider the staggering burst of creativity by authors of computer programs that are
    designed<br> to share audio files.  This was first popularized by Napster, but today several popular applications
    and<br> services offer similar capabilities.  CD-writers have become mainstream, and DVD-writers may well follow<br>
    suit.  Hence, even in the absence of network connectivity, the opportunity for low-cost, large-scale file<br>
    sharing exists.</i></p>
<h2>2  The Darknet</h2>
<p>Throughout this paper, we will call the shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies, books, etc.) objects<u>.
    The persons who copy objects</u> will be called users of the darknet, and the computers used to share objects will
    be called hosts.</p>
<p>The darknet is the distribution network that emerges from the injection of objects according to assumption 1 and the
    distribution of <b>those objects according to assumptions 2 and 3.</b></p>
<p>One implication of the first assumption is that any content protection system will leak popular or interesting
    content into the darknet, because some fraction of users--possibly experts–will overcome any copy prevention
    mechanism or because the object will enter the darknet before copy protection occurs.</p>
<p><b>The term “widely distributed”</b> is intended to capture the notion of mass market distribution of objects to
    thousands or millions of practically anonymous users. <u><i>This is in contrast to the protection of military</i></u>,
    industrial, or personal secrets, which are typically not widely distributed and are not the focus of this paper.</p>
<h2>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h2>
<p>By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to emerge from technological advances in several areas. The internet
    had become mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure could now be relied upon by anyone seeking to
    connect users with a centralized service or with each other. The continuing fall in the price of storage together
    with advances in compression technology had also crossed the threshold at which storing large numbers of audio files
    was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users. Additionally, the power of computers had crossed the point at which
    they could be used as rendering devices for multimedia content. Finally, “CD ripping” became a trivial method
    for content injection.</p>

<b><i>The first embodiments of this new darknet were central internet servers with large collections of MP3 audio files.
    A fundamental change that came with these servers was the use of a new distribution network: The internet
    displaced the sneaker net – at least for audio content. This solved several problems of the old darknet.
    First, latency was reduced drastically.</i></b></p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, discovery of objects became much easier because of simple and powerful
    search mechanisms – most importantly the general-purpose world-wide-web search engine. The local view of
    the small world was replaced by a global view of the entire collection accessible by all users. The main
    characteristic of this form of the darknet was centralized storage and search – a simple architecture that
    mirrored mainstream internet servers.</p>
<h2>2.2 Central Internet Servers</h2>
<p align="right"><i>Centralized or quasi-centralized distribution and service networks make sense for legal online commerce.  Bandwidth
and infrastructure costs tend to be low, and having customers visit a commerce site means the merchant can display
adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.  Additionally, management, auditing, and accountability are much
    easier in a centralized model.</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>However, centralized schemes work poorly for illegal object distribution because large,
    central servers are large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the law,
    it is relatively easy to force him to stop.  Early MP3 Web and FTP sites were commonly “hosted”
    by universities, corporations, and ISPs.  Copyright-holders or their representatives sent “cease and desist”
    letters to these web-site operators and web-owners citing copyright infringement and in a few cases followed
    up with legal action [15].  The threats of legal action were successful attacks on those centralized networks,
    and MP3 web and FTP sites disappeared from the mainstream shortly after they appeared.</p>
